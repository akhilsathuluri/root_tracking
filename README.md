# Root tracking algorithms

A system of parametric nonlinear equations generally produce more than one set of feasible roots when solved. These roots change with the parameter value. 
There are methods like homotopy continuation or paramotopy for tracking the branches of the roots with the change in the parameter. 
This repository contains three implementation of three different algorithms used for root-tracking.
1. Nearest neighbour method
2. Newton-Raphson based method
3. Davidenkos integration based method
